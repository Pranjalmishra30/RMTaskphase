# RoboManipal Taskphase
-------
**Week 1**<br>
1.Started with learning basic git and Linux commands.<br>
2. Understanding the layout of an Arduino board. Started programming with the Arduino IDE and getting familiar with common functions (eg- digitalWrite/Read).<br>
3. Writing and testing out basic Arduino programs for blinking and fading of a LED.<br>
    * In fading used Pulse width modulation(PWM) turning the digital pin on and off with different ratio to create a fading           effect.<br>
4.	Testing out a photoresistor (LDR) and writing a code for a situation, when light in a room is less – the LED should glow.<br>
5.	Worked with 2 types of sensors <br>
    * Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) <br>
        * Works on the same principle as SONAR. Found distance of nearby objects and found out sensor’s range.<br>   
   * IR sensor<br> 
      * Used it to find presence of objects. The sensor works by sending infrared waves and then receiving them.<br> 
      * Also found out a way to calculate distance by relating distance and voltage received by sensor. <br>     
6.	8 array LED <br> 
   * Used in line following robots to navigate a black line on a white background.<br> 
   * Used sensor to differentiate between black and white background. The LED’s light up when they sense white color.<br> 
   * In another application, program the sensor to give out average position of a line. This is especially useful in line    navigation bots.<br>  
7.	Finding about servo and stepper motors. How they function and how they can be used with an Arduino.<br> <br>
**Week 2**<br>
1.Understanding Robot kinematics.<br>
   * World and local coordinates<br>
   * Degree of freedom of joints<br>

2.Learning about Bluetooth Module (HC=05)<br>
   * [reference](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-and-hc-05-bluetooth-module-tutorial/)<br>
3.Establishing communication between 2 Arduinos<br> 
   * Acomplished this by using TX/RX <br>
